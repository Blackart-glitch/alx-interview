# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle 📐

Welcome to the 0x00. Pascal's Triangle short specialization! 🎉 In this specialization, we will explore the concept of Pascal's Triangle and learn how to implement it in Python.

0. Pascal's Triangle
A Python function named `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's triangle of n:

- Returns an empty list if n <= 0
- You can assume n will always be an integer

🔍 Project Files:
The project repository contains the following files:

- 0-pascal_triangle.py: Contains the implementation of the `pascal_triangle` function.
- 0-main.py: A Python script that imports the `pascal_triangle` function and demonstrates its usage by printing the Pascal's triangle for n=5.

💡 How to Run the Demo:
To see the Pascal's triangle in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository `alx-interview`.
2. Navigate to the directory `0x00-pascal_triangle`.
3. Run the Python script `0-main.py` using the command `./0-main.py`.
4. Observe the output with Pascal's triangle for n=5.

🚀 Let's start exploring the magical world of Pascal's Triangle and ace those technical interview questions! 🧙‍♂️ Happy coding! 🎓
